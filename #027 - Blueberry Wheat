Recipe: #027 - Summer Wheat + Blueberry
Brewer: 
Asst Brewer: 
Style: American Wheat Beer
TYPE: All Grain
Taste: (30.0) Blueberry Wheat:

Wicked Purplish Color
Decent head
Suttle blueberry aroma is veyr pleasant.
Probably add 20% more blueberries. I think it was around 4lb for a 20L batch.
Reduce the IBU slightly to maybe 16. Has a slight edgy bitterness that could be reduced to make the blueberry flavour come through.
Clean tasting.

Summer Wheat

Golden/Orange Hazy and cloudy.
Bitterness drop slightly to 18 IBU.
A bit of heat. Drop the ABV to 5%.

Aroma: Malt, Fruit, Clove
Taste: Fruit, clove, dry finish with some malt to follow.
Maybe try with US-05 or reduce fermentation temp to 19C to drive off esters
Maybe try with small amount some citrus type hops (eg. Amarillo, Cascade)

July 5
Aroma: Small bit of wheat/malt. No diacytyl. No hop aroma. 
Appearance: Yellow / Pale Gold. Hazy. White head edges the glass and stays.
Taste: Grainy, Low malt, Little sweet. No hop flavour. A little crisp, but not sharp. Refreshing.
Overall Impression: Reduce the ABV to 5.5% or lower. Overall great beer, reduce ferment temps to 18C.
