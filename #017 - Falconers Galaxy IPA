Smells of peaches, mango, pineapple
Punchy, Juicy, Peach, Mango, Orange, Malty
Smooth bitterness
Maybe consider reducing Munich malt down to 10% to reduce a bit of the malt?

Nov 6
-------------------------------------
Aroma: Pineapple, orange, mango. No detectable flaws. 10/12
Appearance: Orange with golden hues. Foamy head. Very clear for a super hoppy IPA. Especially bottle conditioned. 3/3
Flavour: Bitterness is a slightly harsh, could be water, or just high IBU to ABV ratio? Citrus. Creamsicle. Malt at the very end. Slightly grassy sometimes. 16/20
Mouthfeel: A little thin. Malt doesnâ€™t accentuate as much as it should. Itâ€™s almost there but not quite. I wouldnâ€™t add too much more malt. 3/5
Overall Impression: This is really on the small end of a double IPA. The hops are clean, but I think it could use a bit more malt kick, it really is a good baseline for a DIPA. Overall its a kickass IPA. Definitely to be brewed again.
8/10

Score: 40/50
