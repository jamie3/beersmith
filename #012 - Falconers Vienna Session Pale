Sparge: Batch sparge with 2 steps (Drain mash tun , 26.67l) of 168.0 F water
Notes:
------
- Sparge 10min
- 50/50 RO + Tap water with campden tablet
- 4g CaCl + 2g gypsum into mash
- First running 11L @ 1.061
- Second running from sparge 1.014
- pH ~ 5.0 from measure strip
- 27L post boil, collected 23L. 4L remaining.
- Fermentation held ~18.5-19C
- End of fermentation second week 21 C
- Keg carbonation

Decent mash efficiency but terrible brewhouse efficiency. Possible changes:
- Reduce deadspace
- Increase sparge time
- Drain slower

- Fermentation slow to start. 2 days krauzen formed. Not very vigorous. 

July 14 - Gravity Reading 1.014. Really nice malt aroma. Sort of biscuity/grainy/bready. Little to no hop aroma. Clean bitterness. Vienna malt makes a nice balanced session ale.

End July - Much more hop aroma. Smooth drinking. Brought to a party and it was gone the next day.
